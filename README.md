## Analysis

### 1. **Average Price by Transmission Type (Line Chart)**

####**Question:**  
How does the average price of cars vary across different transmission types (Automatic, Manual, Semi-Auto)?

####**Interpretation:**  
- Automatic cars are the most expensive (~30,000–50,000), followed by Semi-Auto and Manual (~20,000–25,000).  
- A price spike occurs around 22:00, with convergence of Automatic and Semi-Auto prices after 22:15.  
- The market favors automatic transmissions for performance but values manual for cost stability.
